# Boggle Game Application

## Achievements
- **Single-threaded Boggle Board Generation**: Successfully achieved a high-score Boggle board with **4,357 points** using a genetic algorithm in average 20 seconds.
- **Optimized Word Scoring**: Implemented an algorithm that maximizes high-scoring words based on English letter frequency.

## User Interface
The application provides an interactive and intuitive interface for playing the Boggle game. Features include:
- **Dynamic 4Ã—4 Board**: Real-time generation and display of the optimized Boggle board.
- **Word Input & Validation**: Users can enter words, and the system validates them against the dictionary.
- **Scoring System**: Automatic score calculation based on word length and predefined point values.
- **Leaderboard**: Tracks and displays high scores for competitive play.

## Services & Architecture
The application is built with TypeScript and follows a modular architecture. Key services include:

### 1. **Board Generation Service**
   - Implements a **genetic algorithm** to evolve high-scoring Boggle boards.
   - Uses English letter frequency to generate an initial board.
   - Iteratively improves board configurations to maximize word scores.

### 2. **Word Validation Service**
   - Checks if a given word exists in the dictionary in a trie datastructure.
   - Ensures words follow the adjacency rules of the Boggle board.

### 3. **Scoring Service**
   - Calculates scores dynamically based on the Boggle rules.
   - Provides bonus points for longer words and rare letter combinations.

### 4. **Game State Management**
   - Manages user interactions, tracking submitted words and scores.
   - Supports session persistence for continuous gameplay.
   - Base component for multiplayer and multi team boggle game.

## Future Enhancements
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Enable real-time competition with multiple players.
- **Performance Optimization**: Improve efficiency of board generation and word validation.
