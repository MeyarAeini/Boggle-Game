# Boggle web application

The porpuse of this project is to deliver a user interface for a boggle game player or a team of players.


## Challenges

- Have a game session shared by multiple user on a realtime. Lets suppose 100 users wants to join a single boggle game, and they all should start the game at the same time, they should know a summary about the status of others, atleast they should know who is leading the game or what is the biggest word found until now. All this information or this kind of information should be shared on a realtime. Considering that this kind of game will finish in couple of minuets, and the nature of these games is the speed so sharing the statuses without intruption is a key player on them.
